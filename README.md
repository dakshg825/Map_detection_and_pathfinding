# Map_detection_and_pathfinding

Summary:
To get the required outputs, I first ran the training notebook which would create some randomly generated maps by using a sample map and some pictures of the obstacles available with the challenge. Then using the models trained by the training notebook the pathfinding notebook ran obstacle detection on the map (Appropriate paths to be provided in place of the path names given by me)
